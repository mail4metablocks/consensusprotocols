# consensusprotocols
Usage of consesus protocols  distributed systems, including blockchains, distributed databases, and distributed file systems

Consensus protocols are algorithms that allow a group of distributed nodes to reach consensus on a single value or a set of values in a distributed network. These protocols are used to ensure that all nodes in the network agree on the current state of the network and can continue to agree on future states, even in the presence of network partitions, faulty nodes, or malicious actors.

Consensus protocols are used in various distributed systems, including blockchains, distributed databases, and distributed file systems. They play a critical role in ensuring the integrity and reliability of these systems, as they ensure that all nodes in the network have a consistent view of the data.

There are several different types of consensus protocols, including proof-of-work (PoW), proof-of-stake (PoS), and practical Byzantine fault tolerance (PBFT). Each type of consensus protocol has its own set of rules and mechanisms for reaching consensus, and they differ in terms of their complexity, efficiency, and security.

In general, consensus protocols involve the following steps:

Nodes in the network propose values for the next state of the network.
Nodes vote on the proposed values, either by showing proof of work (in the case of PoW) or by staking a certain amount of tokens (in the case of PoS).
The node or group of nodes with the most votes is chosen to create the next state of the network.
The new state is broadcast to all nodes in the network, and the nodes verify that the new state is valid.
If the new state is valid, it is accepted as the current state of the network. If it is not valid, the process starts again from step 1.

### Implementation

In this example, the Node class represents a node in the network, and the Network class represents the network of nodes. The Network class has a runConsensus method that runs the consensus protocol until all nodes in the network agree on a value.

The consensus protocol works by having each node propose a value, and the node with the highest value is chosen as the agreed value. If there is a tie, the node with the most votes wins. The votes are initially set to 1 for each node, but they can be incremented if multiple nodes propose the same value.
